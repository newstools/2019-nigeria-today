A member of the House of Representatives Committee on Petroleum Resources (Upstream) Hon. Unyime Idem has challenged the  Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation – NNPC to ensure it increases production capacities and also come up with other strategies that will help reduce the nation’s budget deficit. Hon. Idem stated this when the Group Managing Director of NNPC, Mr Mele Kyari appeared before the Committee in Abuja on Monday. While expressing worry over Nigeria’s huge debt profile, the member representing Ukanafun/Oruk Anam Federal Constituency in the National Assembly urged NNPC to submit a written strategy to the committee for necessary legislative action in order to stop or reduce perpetual borrowing to fund the budget deficit in the next three years. He said with improved production capacity, curtailing of oil bunkering, and nipping of other sharp practices in bud, the industry will improve its revenue. Recall that the budget as presented by President Muhammadu Buhari to the National Assembly is projected to decrease to N1.86 trillion or 1.3% of GDP in 2019 from N1.95 trillion projected for 2018 while the sum of N2.14 trillion was set aside for debt servicing, a development Hon. Idem said is detrimental to the economy of the nation. Meanwhile, answering a question on the technical capacity of the NNPC to properly manage oil exploration, refinery and sales, Kyari admitted that there was enough manpower in the petroleum sector to develop the industry but that the experts had not been properly engaged, adding that his leadership is working to  address that in order to boast revenue from the sector.
