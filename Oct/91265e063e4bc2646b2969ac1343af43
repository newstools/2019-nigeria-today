By Abel Udoekene “To say that we find ourselves in a society where most people claimed to be more holy than the pope is an understatement” For me, it’s feel like we are at the mercy of those who oppressed us, those who are always struggling to discredit our opinion, those who claimed to know everything about democracy, governance and our way of life and those who are constantly hurt when we celebrate excellent, capacity and good governance. To say the least, our society has been skewed in such a way that we are selective in the way we celebrate kindness. And most times, those who stand to dance with the drummer are often seen as sycophants; and the naysayers can even swear that the only perfect scenario is when the drummer drums and dance alone. Sometimes ago, we celebrated democracy as the best form of governance; in our documents of trust, we declared that democracy promotes freedom and most importantly freedom of choice which is the greatest gift that nature has bestowed to mankind. But our oppressors are always dancing round the corner sowing seed of discord and disunity in our society, misleading the public because of our choices, are we no longer free to choose? If a drummer drums very well, is it a crime for the people to celebrate and encourage the drummer to Keep drumming? I am of the opinion that diversity is a strength not a weakness. And our society can only grow when people learn to respect other people’s choices and opinion, when we realized that we different in many ways, and we are also the same in many ways. Having different opinion and views about governance or life should not make us enermies, rather it should remind us that we are humans and we have the greatest gift of nature “The power of choice” in our hands.
