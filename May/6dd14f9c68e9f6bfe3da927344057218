By Abel Udoekene Liverpool football club has pulled one of the greatest comeback in Football history as they beat Barcelona football club 4 – 0 in the Second leg of the Champions League Semi final tie. A first half goal by D Origi and three second half goal by G Wijnaldum and Origi was enough to cancel out the 3-0 goal lead by Barcelona from the first leg. The absence of Mohammed Salah was a plus for the reds as most fans complained of his selfishness inside the 18 yard box. Liverpool will be waiting for the winner between Totheham football Club and Ajax FC to determine who wins this year’s Champions league. Follow us on twitter @NigeriaTodayNG Also, Like us on facebook
