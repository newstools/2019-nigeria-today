By Abasiama EtukAkpan In all honesty, one public office holder in Akwa Ibom State has been very dear to my heart due to his style of leadership. That gentleman is Hon. Frank Archibong, the Executive Chairman of Eket Local Government Area. Most times, i feel like he would’ve been my own Chairman because i like his kind of leadership. Pardon me, i choose to love and appreciate this one because he knows what public office entails and has been doing his best to ensure he changes the narrative of leadership in Akwa Ibom State and Nigeria.  By the grace of God,he is the Chairman of ALGON in Akwa Ibom State and the National Treasurer of ALGON in the Federal Republic of Nigeria.A position that he has brought his wealth of experience to bear in the discharge of his duties which he has done faithfully and in an  excellent manner.  I will x-ray only three of his outstanding attributes that you need to know about the EKET Number one citizen and this is done with all honesty and sincerity.  HUMBLE;There are thirty-one in number that are in the third tier of government,his humility is second to none among the others.He doesn’t see his position as one that should change his person or make him to look down on anyone.He sees everyone as himself and believes intrinsically in equality to life prism.He doesn’t discriminate and will never look down on anyone no matter who the person is.If you meet him in his house, he can even serve you meal,drink or water by himself no matter how small or big you are in the society.I wonder how he survives with this kind of attribute of extreme humility.This is one of the sterling attributes that endears me to this gentleman and I will always emulate his humility and simplicity in Leadership.  PHILANTHROPY;Again,among the other thirty one,i can say anytime any day that he is the greatest philanthropy among all.He gives joyfully and doesn’t look back when he gives.His philanthropic life knows no bounds and he is one gentleman that can sacrifice his last for his neighbor and ensures the next person close to him is happy and satisfied.He has been giving out his last to ensure he puts smiles on the faces of his people.I envy Eket Local Government Area for this special breed in Leadership.He is one public officer holder that I know that he changes the story of any one that comes in contact with him.He is a fine gentleman in this area and I salute his gift of giving, touching and changing lives.He is a fine gentleman with a large heart to accommodate everyone at everytime.  INTELLIGENT; Without sounding immodest,few leaders are intelligent  and have anything upstairs.Among the few that are sound and intelligent,i can authoritatively say that Mr Frank Archibong is one leader with very intelligent approach to issues and his leadership style is uncommon.His intelligence has placed Eket Local Government Area in her rightful place in the comity  of Local Government Areas.His decisions and approach to issues places him above his contemporaries.He is a fine breed that should be given leadership position again,again and again which I can vouge that he will not disappoint his people any time any day.  In Conclusion,Hon.Frank Archibong is one fine gentleman with very excellent records.He is one gentleman that has brought in an extraordinary mien in leadership.One leader with outstanding attributes which is worth emulating.A great hand in grassroot development.He is my kind of leader and I hold him in high esteem for his examplary leadership style.A great hand in grassroot development with the capacity to deliver at all times.
