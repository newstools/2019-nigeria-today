It is a Sunday morning, and I woke up to reminiscent on the less than 1km remaining for the completion of the Uyo – Ikot Ekpene Road project. This dualized road, built particularly into the heart of Ikot Ekpene people, is gradually fulfilling Governor Emmanuel’s recent promise that this dry season will come with intense accelerated projects execution in the state. Modern appeal, high quality and top class finishing. It re-ignites that age long bond between Uyo people and their brothers in the Raffia city. More so, it also gives the federal government another food for thought, on the level of expectations in the long abandoned Aba -Ikot Ekpene and Umuahia – Ikot Ekpene road.
Perhaps those who championed the scam called Ikot Ekpene – Itu – Odukpani Road project, with spur to Ididep, may see this and have a rethink on what a federal road project should better look like, if truly they have the interest of Akwa Ibom at heart. #AkwaIbomTrulyDeservesTheBest from the federal government. #ConnectWithUdom
