Press Release We have read a statement on the social media  credited to our revered and deeply admired Traditional Ruler, the Alaafin of Oyo-HRM Lamidi  Adeyemi 111  where he was said to have advised politicians not to be desperate about who their successors are. In the said statement, the revered Monarch was quoted to have said “Akpabio told me that Udom will be his successor; he said it is Udom or nobody. Same Udom told EFCC that Akpabio kept dollars in his house, only God saved him,” We would have out rightly dismissed the  above statement as yet another manufactured tissue of lies that daily populate the social media space, but given the fact that the statement was attributed to our revered Monarch, we are constrained to state the facts right. The Statement in the first instance is false. Governor Udom Emmanuel, a man of integrity and of sound judgement will never do such a despicable thing. The statement that is credited to the Alaafin was a piece of propaganda material some political elements had pushed in 2017, which was later dismissed and discarded for what it was- propaganda material. Governor Emmanuel never told the EFCC that Akpabio kept dollars in his house. The EFCC, had in  September 2015, invaded a section of the Government House, Uyo where Senator Akpabio had stayed for a few days, an act that was roundly condemned. In the aftermath of the illegal invasion, an errant reporter, obviously sponsored, had written the false story that stacks of Dollar notes were found in Government House. This report was later dismissed as false. We hold the highly respected Monarch in high esteem, hence the need to put this fact right. Signed: Ekerete Udoh
