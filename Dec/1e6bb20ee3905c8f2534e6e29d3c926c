urges Nigerians to emulate the state’s green farm project Former President of Nigeria, Chief Olusegun Obasanjo, has commended the Akwa Ibom State Governor, Mr Udom Emmanuel, for his landmark achievements in agricultural production and food sufficiency in the State. Chief Obasanjo made the commendation while fielding questions from Government House Correspondents after his brief stop over at the Green House Farm along Victor Attah International Airport, Uyo , during his visit to the state for the burial of former Secretary to the Government of the federation, late Chief Ufot Ekaette . Chief Obasanjo who described the Green House project as a laudable initiative which should be emulated by Nigerians to encourage sufficient production of tomatoes and other food crops, added that such measure will give Nigeria an edge in food production rather than depend on importation from other countries. His words: “the Governor should be encouraged, one of the things that pained me is when I hear that most of the vegetables we use in Lagos including tomatoes, carrots, cabbage, lettuce and others are flown in from other countries. The land of such countries are not fertile than ours that they export vegetables to us. So what the Governor is doing here is very good”. Obasanjo who is the Chief Executive Officer, Otta Farm , Ogun State, used the occasion of the visit to call on the state government to privatize the green house project, explaining that privatisation would sustain the project beyond the present administration.
