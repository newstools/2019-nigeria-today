Akwa Ibom State Head of Civil Service, Elder Effiong Essien made this known over the weekend in Uyo while appearing on a Live Planet Radio 101.1FM interview programme – “Akwa Ibom Mandate”. The Head of Service said, as a People-oriented and God-fearing leader, Governor Udom Emmanuel has since assumption of office not relented in intervening from time to time on the welfare of retired Primary school teachers under the Local Government Service and so will again interface with LG administrators to find solution to the pending pension arrears. Elder Effiong Essien who was reacting to the peaceful demonstration of a section of Next- of- kin of late Retired Primary School Teachers over non-payment of arrears of Pensions said, as a listening and sympathetic leader, Governor Udom Emmanuel had swiftly swung into action by directing him, the Head of Civil Service to address the demonstrating group when he heard of their presence. Emphasizing that, the grievances of the next-of-kin of the late retired Primary school teachers rest squarely on the Local Government Service, the Head of Civil Service said, Governor Udom Emmanuel as the father of all the people in Akwa Ibom State, will however look into ways of ameliorating the plight of the next-of-kin of late retired Primary school teachers by engaging Local Government administrators and the Joint State/Local Government Allocation Accounts for the way forward. He recalled that on assumption of office, Governor Udom Emmanuel had cleared 10 years backlog of  gratuities of retired primary school teachers in the state reiterating that, the left-over will surely be looked into by the caring Governor who has so far ensured that, Pensions are put at first line charge being paid regularly as at when due. On the authenticity of the Next-of-kin of late Retired Teachers and indeed other class of workers in the state, Elder Essien said, documentation is very critical in the Service as records of Next-of-kin of workers are documented from the day of employment of workers for future reference when need arises. Speaking on the refund of the 7.5% Contributory Pensions to beneficiaries which was suspended, the Head of Civil Service said, he met the suspension order on assumption of office, adding that, his office is however working out modalities to reactivate the refunds of the contributory pensions to benefitting workers.
