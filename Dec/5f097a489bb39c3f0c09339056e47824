……Says Lands Commissioner is a thorough man The Senior Special Assistant on Niger Delta Affairs to President Muhammadu Buhari, Senator Ita Enang has thrown his weight behind the demolition of structures at Nung Oku in Ibesikpo local Government Area of Akwa Ibom State on Friday, 20, Saturday 21 and Monday 23rd of December. Speaking to this reporter on Thursday, December 26, the President’s aide noted that people were fond of encroaching on government’s property.
“People will expect me to condemn the demolition of yesterday because I’m APC but I won’t do that. What we should find out is that if they are building on Government’s land or another person’s land, you’re a trespasser”, he asserted. “When you are buying a land, make sure the person that’s selling the land is the owner of the land. You don’t buy land and take it away. The document in your hand is the land”. “I understand that the government bought that land and had paid the community for the land. Before you cry, show approved building plan, land documents and other titled documents. You don’t see a land and start building”, he stressed. “The same thing happened on the Calabar Itu road. People were building on the corridors of the road. What is on government land belongs to the government. Anyone who sees anything that’s not right on his or her land at anytime would want to take it off. “I am not a political friend with the Commissioner for Lands but I know he is a very thorough person. Whatever he does, we should find out the reason first” Ita Enang said. Meanwhile, the Commissioner for Lands and Housing, Arc. Ime Ekpo has clarified that the demolition of structures on the portion of the land was carried out on Monday 23rd and Tuesday 24th of December, and not on Christmas Day, as is being reported.
