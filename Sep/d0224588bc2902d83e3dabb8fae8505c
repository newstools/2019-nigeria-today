By Martin Inyangetor The Publicity Secretary of the Akwa Ibom State Chapter of the Peoples’ Democratic Party, PDP, Comrade Ini Ememobong has charged the Trainees and Beneficiaries of the Umbrella Empowerment Program to make the best out of the golden opportunity made possible for them by the PDP under the leadership of Governor Udom Emmanuel and Obong Paul Ekpo, stressing that such opportunity may be a stepping stone for a successful and prosperous life. Ememobong made this known earlier today when he led members of the Publicity Secretariat on an on-the-spot assessment and evaluation of the progress made by trainees of the Umbrella Empowerment Program at various Fashion Training Centers(Men’s Court, Osongama Street and Atarrah Fashion House, Nwaniba Road) in Uyo. While commending the Trainers for their consistency, diligence, hardwork, ability to make an indeleble mark in the Fashion industry and for accepting to support and train the Beneficiaries of the program, Ememobong said that he was optimistic that the required knowledge through the training will be imparted to the trainees as the decision taken by the Trainees to take up a skill is indeed a step in the right direction and a path to greatness. The State Publicity Secretary used the medium to admonish the trainees on the need to make the best out of the opportunity made possible for them, as such opportunity is one of the greatest empowerment opportunities which may help make them build Akwa Ibom better as drivers of our state economy. He charged “If you dare to design, there is someone that will dare to wear it, so don’t localise your dream and skill nor limit your exploit but take advantage of fashion innovations and trends as this will help make you stamp your feets in the global map of fashion”. In their seperate responses on behalf of the Trainees, Miss Anthonia Bassey of Nsit Ubium and Sarafina Sampson of Uyo thanked the leadership of the party under Gov Udom Emmanuel and Obong Paul Ekpo for the opportunity, maitaining that the trainees are grateful and appreciative of the opportunity given them. They also thanked the trainers for giving them the right training so far while pledging to make the best out of the training as admonished.
