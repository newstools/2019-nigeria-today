Agency Report The Delta State government says all is set for the commencement of its 2019/2020 programme cycle of its job creation programme. The Chief Job and Wealth Creation Officer, Eric Eboh, said this on Tuesday in Asaba during a work plan and implementation guideline meeting with members of staff. Mr Eboh said the meeting was necessary following the approval of the 2019/2020 Job Creation Programme Work plan and Implementation Guideline by the State Executive Council. According to him, the guideline will be published and issued to all the trainees, trainers, guarantors and to all stakeholders to update them on innovations and adjustments in the curriculum and training modules initiated after a thorough review of the programme in the last four years. Mr Eboh said the programmes were open to the unemployed youth between 18 years and 35 years with a minimum qualification of West Africa School Certificate and those who completed the Senior Secondary Certificates Examination. He noted that degree and HND holders should have their NYSC discharge certificates or letters of exemption. He said the youth, who desired to be trained and established under ”Green STEP and YAGEP”, must have the passion to acquire skills and to establish and run business enterprises on their own. Mr Eboh said the introduction of the Post Training Proficiency Test (PTPT), was compulsory for all ”Green STEP” beneficiaries on completion of their vocational training.
