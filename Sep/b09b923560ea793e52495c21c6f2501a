By Nsikak Pius Early last week a friend of mine notify me of an alleged meeting between a close friend of Senator Godswill Akpabio and Justice Tahir Sheriff. Though, I didn’t get the details of the meeting, but the recent display of shame by my very revered friend, Justice Sheriff has suggested that he may have been compromised. Firstly, I wonder why a man who has been on the forefront of Justice for over a decade could have abandoned his duties at the tribunal of which he is adequately paid to do. Secondly, a closer look at his so called minority judgement is laughable. Even a sane man can understand that election was done on unit bases not the collation centre. So the decision of the tribunal rejecting Akpabio’s petition based on his failure to prove that he won the election unit by unit is highly commendable. It is obviously very clear that why other Judges were convinced by the evidences put forth before the tribunal, Justice Sheriff may have been convinced by other things. This current trend set by some of our money loving Judges is weakening our democracy. Justice Sheriff should know that the eyes of history is watching and soon the truth will reveal itself.
