The Deputy Chairman House Committee on Communications in the National Assembly, Hon. Unyime Idem has urged the Nigerian Communications Commission- NCC to consult widely to ensure a smooth take off of the Emergency Communication Centres across the country. Speaking during the budget defense of the commission before the Joint Communications Committee Meeting of the National Assembly, presided over by the Chairman of the Senate Committee on Communications, Senator Oluremi Tinubu, Hon. Idem while commending the move said it was important for the NCC to close ranks with related agencies to avoid repetition of budgetary allocation for the same project. The move, according to the commission, is part of its mandate to “promote and enhance public safety through the use of a particular number which shall be designated as the Universal Safety and Emergency Assistance Number for telephone services generally.” The commission said the centres would be launched in various states of the federation and the Federal Capital Territory. NCC said the centres would enable Nigerians to access help from any response agency such as the Police, Federal Road Safety Corps, Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps, Fire and Ambulance Services by simply dialing the toll free number 112 from any network.
