By Nelson NseAbasi Cross River State Government has commenced the search for talented artistes who require the necessary push to catapult them from street to stardom. Themed ‘Calabar Talent Factory’ , it is an initiative of the Cross River state Government in partnership with 1327 Entertainment to create a platform that would unearth new talents from the state. The platform would become an avenue through which splendor and creative ingenuity of youths in the state would be showcased to the world, especially through the internationally acclaimed Calabar Festival events. Talent Factory would position the state, under the leadership of Sir Ben Ayade as one that invests in talents and human capacity development, through the discovery and promotion of local talents in the state. The event which would attract the cream-de-la-cream in the music industry and beyond, would feature top Record Labels, Artistes and their managers looking out for talents that can take the world by storm.
