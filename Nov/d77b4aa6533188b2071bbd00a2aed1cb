…as Education monitoring Team intensifies spot- checks in Schools By Emma Akpabio In her avowed commitment to ensuring that her free and compulsory Education for primary and Secondary School Children in the State is qualitative enough, the Akwa Ibom State Government under the leadership of Governor Udom Emmanuel has again, frowned at Teachers with poor attitude to work, while promising to end loitering in Schools. Consequently, over 150 Teachers culpable of lateness and absenteeism have been recommended for sanctions. However, the Governor’s office Education monitoring team led by the Senior Special Assistant to the Governor on Education Monitoring – Mrs Idongesit Etiebet, restated the Governor’s commitment to education on Tuesday, November 26, 2019, while addressing Teachers and Students during an on-the-spot Check to Schools in Uyo, Akwa Ibom State capital. The Team which also consisted of the representative of the Education Commissioner – Barr Mrs Attih, NAPTAN Chairman – Elder Ataide and Governor’s Aide on Research and development – SA Essien Ndueso, paid unscheduled visits to Cornelia Cornelley College – Afaha Oku, Offot Ukwa Secondary School and Primary School Mbierebe Obio where they monitored school resumption time, conduct of Morning devotion as well as review records and Movement books. In every school visited, the monitoring team which arrives notorious schools before 7.30am, takes part in the early morning devotion and counsels Students and pupils on the need to shun Cultism and other social vices capable of destroying their future. Though a greater percentage of Students as observed by the monitoring team arrive school late, all Students who arrived school after 8.00am promised to turn a new live through the undertakings administered to all victims of lateness. Meanwhile, the team which also discovered some irregularities in the record and movement books for Teachers, frowned at Principals and Head Teachers who create room for lateness and absenteeism without sanctions. Etiebet who presided over brief meetings held with Teachers, called on them to be role models, stressing that the responsibilities of Teachers are not just to teach in classes, but to be role models outside the class rooms and the society at large. The Governor’s Aide while reiterating the Governor’s interest in the education sector, also disclosed that the Governor has zero – tolerance for unprofessionalism. Etiebet charged principals to submit names of Teachers who arrived school after 8.00am to her office, for onward submission to the Governor’s desk for sanctions. As at the time of filing this report, more than 150 names of Teachers were pencilled down for sanctions. Recall that in the last one month, several Schools have been visited by state Government’s education monitoring team in about 10 Local government areas. While a total number of 71 Students were recently placed on indefinite suspension by the State Government for gross misconduct. From information gathered, the spot- Check promises to be a continuum.         Follow us on twitter @NigeriaTodayNG Also, Like us on facebook
