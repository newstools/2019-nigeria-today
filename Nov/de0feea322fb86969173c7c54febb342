We have been briefed by the State Legal Adviser of our Party, Goddy Umoh Esq, on the judgement of the Court of Appeal in the Appeal filed in respect of Mbo state Constituency wherein the appellate court allowed the appeal and declared the candidate of the APC, Chief Effiong Johnson as the winner of the elections. As a law abiding institution, we respect the judgment, there being no other avenue of legal adjudication on this matter. The court process is a part of the electoral system and must be respected whether the outcome is favorable or not. We urge our party faithful in Mbo to receive this judgement with maturity and conduct themselves in the vintage peaceful disposition of our party. As lawyers and litigants are expected by best practice to say, post judgement, AS THE COURT PLEASES! Signed : Comrade Ini Ememobong
