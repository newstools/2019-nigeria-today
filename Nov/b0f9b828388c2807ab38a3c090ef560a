Hon. Udo Kierian Akpan, I speak for the people of Oruk Anam through the mandate they gave me” he noted “Mr. Speaker, I have carefully listened to the mover of this motion and I want to say that there’s an existing law concerning the employment of indigenous youths in the state, and it’s high time we get those laws working. “Mr Speaker, what my brother and colleague Rt Hon. Aniekan Uko is simply doing is awakening our consciousness in response to the reality and plight of our youths. “As lawmakers armed with the mandate of our constituents it’s our duty to draw the attention of ministry of youth and sport and other relevant agency to furnish the assembly with information concerning the employment of our youths from the companies operating it the state.” Sir Kierian further stressed the need to monitor and ensure that all companies or individual who doesn’t comply with the laws are made to face the full wrath of the law.
