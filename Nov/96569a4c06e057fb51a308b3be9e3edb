By Emma Akpabio In a bid to ensure a healthy living for waste evacuators, residents and citizens of Akwa Ibom State, the Chairman – Akwa Ibom State Environmental Protection and waste Management Agency – Hon. Prince Ikim, has directed all resource persons handling waste Evacuation in the State to ensure absolute compliance with the international best practices in their daily activities. Ikim who gave the directive over the weekend during an inspection visit to the temporary dump site located in the State capital, along Uyo Village Road, frowned at evacuators who were not properly kitted in line with safety principles and standards of the Agency. “When dealing with waste, employers have a general duty of care under the Health and safety at work. During the orientation program we organized for all contractors, we had emphasize that for safety sake, all employees; ranging from those employed for sweeping of roads, disilting of gutters, cutting of grasses and waste evacuators must be provided with personal protection clothing and tools appropriate to the tasks they are required to perform.” Ikim added. Speaking further, the waste management Boss who promised to sanction any contractor that treats safety with kids gloves, commended Robust Technologies for her consistency and called on other contractors to emulate them. Ikim however, charged all contractors handling disilting of gutters to take advantage of the dry season to clean all the gutters in their respective zones, adding that no contractor found wanting will be spared.
