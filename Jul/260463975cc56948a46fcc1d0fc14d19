By Emma Akpabio The Federal government of Nigeria led by President Muhammadu Buhari this afternoon, by implication, confirmed that the former Deputy Governor of Akwa Ibom State and Senator representing Akwa Ibom North West Senatorial District in the National Assembly will be a Senator of the federal republic till 2023. This was evident in the list of Ministerial Nominees submitted by the President to the National Assembly. Chief Godswill Akpabio who challenged the Victory of Senator Ekpenyong in Court, is one of the 43 men nominated to be ministers of the federal republic of Nigeria. From all indications, the former Governor of Akwa Ibom State who was at the verge of losing the challenge at the National Election Tribunal may withdraw the case in court so as to be focus with his new political appointment or leave it in oblivion.
