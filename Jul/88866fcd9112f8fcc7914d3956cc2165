 Mr Brendan Etukidem, the PDP ward agent for Odoro Ikot 2, ward 7, Essien Udim Local Government Area refuted the testimony of PW6, The police officer who testifed in favour of Chief Godswill Akpabio in the suit between himself and Senator Christopher Ekpenyong. The witness adopted his written statement on oath as his evidence before the court. Under cross examinations, the witness was emphatic in his assertion that there was no election in Odoro Ikot 2, Ward 7. In his reason, he stated that there was violence in his ward, that some hoodlums stormed the INEC- Registration Area Centre and carried away the materials for the elections. He further confirmed that due to such infractions, there was neither accreditation nor voting at the polling units in his ward. Consequently, he stressed that any election results purported to be from his ward are fake. All efforts by the Petitioner’s lawyer to discredit Mr Etukidem’s testimony appeared to have very little or no effect on the veracity of his testimony. Recall that PW6, a police officer had testified that elections were free, fair and peaceful all over Essien Udim Local Government Area in the National Assembly elections. With this deep countering testimony of Mr Etukidem, all is now left to the court to determine whom to believe given other sorrounfing evidence available before the court.
