…Advise him to face his troubles with the ICPC It was indeed a bad day for Senator Godswill Akpabio as his attempt to launder his badly battered image suffered a huge embarrassment across the State yesterday. Akpabio had made elaborate plans to donate some medical equipment that were recovered over a week ago by the agents of the Independent Corrupt Practices Commission (ICPC)  from a company allegedly owned by him to hospitals across the  State. But his Greek gifts were roundly rejected by the youths across the State. It would be recalled that over a week ago, agents of the ICPC had raided a company in Essien Udim allegedly owned by Akpabio and carted away hospital equipment that were meant for his constituency but which he had  immorally diverted for person use. Some of the recovered equipment were later taken to hospitals in Ikot Ekpene  Senatorial District, which were the intended recipients. Embarrassed and disgraced by the incident, Akpabio was said to have confided to close friends that he would donate the remaining stolen equipment to hospitals across the State as a way to seek forgiveness from the people whom he had cheated by diverting the equipment meant for his people. Yesterday, the youths turned out in thousands across the State and told Akpabio to go and face his troubles with the ICPC and not “try to fool us with his tricks. “How come he is trying to donate these equipment now? Why did he divert them for personal use in the first instance? I think he is clever by half by thinking that he can play a fast one on us. “These medical equipment were meant for his constituency, yet he diverted them for personal use. “Having been investigated by the ICPC and the equipment eventually recovered by the ICPC agents, he now wants to donate the equipment. Why did he not donate them initially? “We have told him to stop taking or people for granted” a youth leader, Sylvester T. Akpan stated. Follow us on twitter @NigeriaTodayNG Also, Like us on facebook
