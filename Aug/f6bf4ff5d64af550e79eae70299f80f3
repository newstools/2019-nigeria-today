By Essien Ndueso Governor Udom Emmanuel took a major leap in his message of unity and brotherliness yesterday at the Ati Annang Foundation headquarters in Ikot Ekpene. During the Silver Jubilee of Ati Annang, he defied political party boarders and celebrated the leader of the APC in Akwa Ibom State, Atuekong Don Etiebet, on his induction into the Annang Hall of Fame. Don Etiebet was honoured as a former Federal Minister from Annang Nation, a pacesetter in the telecommunications and ICT industry in the country. He was also recognised for his ability to float a national political party (now defunct NCPN) and his courage to emerge a strong contender in the 1999 presidential elections, where Olusegun Obasanjo emerged winner. Governor Emmanuel described Chief Etiebet in glowing terms as “Èté ñwân idá”, (my precious father inlaw) He also presented the induction certificate to him personally, thereby sending a strong message to other prominent Annang sons who erroneously shun the unity and progressive nature of the assemblage on the basis of politics. Governor Emmanuel has repeatedly insisted that political parties are mere vehicles for political attainments and that what should matter more for Akwa Ibom people should be the peace, unity and development of the state, especially since elections had long been won and lost.
