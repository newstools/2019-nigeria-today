….cautions against 2023 agitations The Peoples Democratic Party, yesterday, on August 29, 2019 refuted the speculations peddled by some local tabloids in the state that the state Party Chairman, Obong Paul Ekpo misappropriated some monies approved by the state government for the award of contracts to the Local Government Chapter Chairmen of the party. Speaking at the event of the presentation of cheques to the winners of the 15, 16 and 17 edition of the Umbrella business quest empowerment program, the State Publicity Secretary of the Party, Comrade Ini Ememobong condemned the baseless speculations by some local tabloid wherein it was alleged that the state chairman of the party diverted funds which were originally designated as funding for various contracts promised by the state government to the local government chapter chairmen of the party. Comrade Ememobong, in his response described such speculations as being actuated by bad faith and a crusade targeted at tarnishing the hard earned reputation of integrity gathered through the years by the party Chairman, Obong Ekpo. Obong Ekpo who presented the cheques to most of the winners of the Business Quest,expressed gratitude over the sustainability of the initiative and emphasized the party’s readiness to champion an economic renaissance through the funding of small and medium scale enterprises. Commenting on the allegation of misappropriation of funds as reported against him, the Chairman stated that he was not surprised and in fact expected more attacks from the source whom he identified as people who have not made peace with their established defeat. He added that he is aware of plans by some persons to make publications, print posters and create scenarios to indicate that he wants to contest for the Governorship position in 2023. *Just like the unfounded embezzlement allegation, there are also rumours that I have commenced consultations to contest as governor by 2023. This, like other ill motivated stories are indeed ludicrous. The Governor which we supported has just started serving his second term and it would be very irresponsible to commence agitation for 2023* Recall that the chairman, in April this year had cautioned party faithfuls against a too sudden debacle on the political realities of 2023, stating that all such discussions and deliberation run contrary to the fundamentals of the party and may “…affect the quality of dedication to the execution of the completion agenda of His Excellency, Mr Udom Emmanuel.” Follow us on twitter @NigeriaTodayNG Also, Like us on facebook
