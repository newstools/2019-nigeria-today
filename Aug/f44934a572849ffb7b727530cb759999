Agency Report Afropop star, Ayodeji Balogun, aka Wizkid, has become the first African artiste to hit eight million listeners on Spotify’s monthly streams. Spotify is an online, music streaming platform that pays royalties based on the number of artistes’ streams as a proportion of total songs streamed. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that streaming records revealed Wizkid’s popularity on the platform on Monday. The previous record was held by Congolese rapper and singer, Maitre Gims. He had seven million monthly listeners. This win follows Wizkid’s recent collaboration with DJ Spinall and Tiwa Savage on ‘Dis Love’. The singer also featured on ‘Like,’ a new single by British-Ghanaian rapper and singer, Kojo Funds. The music star is also the first African artist to walk the runway at a Dolce and Gabbana fashion show while his music `Soco’ played at the background.
