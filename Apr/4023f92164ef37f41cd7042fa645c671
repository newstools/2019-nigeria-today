Eden Hazard will be offered £400,000-a-week to join Real Madrid this summer and a new house, the UK Sun reports. The Belgian superstar is ready to quit Chelsea and has his heart set on a move to Spain. Zinedine Zidane is back in charge at the Santiago Bernabeu and is planning to overhaul his squad after this season. Hazard is top of his wish list and Zidane is also said to want Manchester United’s Paul Pogba. For Hazard, Madrid will sweeten the deal, by throwing in a luxury property and help with his relocation costs. Chelsea won’t stand in the player’s way but expect the LaLiga giants to get near their £95million valuation, even though Hazard’s contract expires in summer 2020.
